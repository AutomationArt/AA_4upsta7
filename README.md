## 4upsta7 5V (for Automation.art)

#### Right away about bugs that were fixed in the scheme after the first prototype) 
!When the charging current decreased from 3A to 1A, the LED indicator turned off, but it shouldn't have)

###  How does it work?
You plug the lamp into USB and it will never turn off again. If the light turns off, the lamp continues to work for 2 or more hours (depending on your battery). That is, the battery charges very quickly and does not discharge very quickly. When there are power outages, you can quickly charge and not be in the dark.

### Main features
- Usb Type-C input 5V
- Current to charge 3 amps
- Load current 2 amps 
- Charge and standby indicator
- Seamless switching from power to battery
- Possibility to connect a high-capacity battery
- Button to disconnect power via connectors (or jumper)
- Connectors for connecting directly to the battery
- Connectors for connection to DCDC converter
- The bottom of the board is made in such a way to allow connection of a heatsink cooler
- Connectors for connecting external power supply 5V outside USB

### Examples of use
- It's simple. Uninterrupted operation of lighting, low-consumption equipment 5V 2A (possibly more)
